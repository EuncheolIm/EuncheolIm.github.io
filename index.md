# About Me
I am interested in manipulation using robotic arms. My current research focuses on <span class="skyblue-text">manipulation </span> , specifically object manipulation using Model Predictive Control (MPC). Recently, I have also developed an interest in <span class="skyblue-text">loco-manipulation </span> . To explore this field, I am conducting study(research) on <span class="skyblue-text"> locomotion</span>  using Whole Body Control (WBC).

My ultimate research goal is to enable robots to be effectively utilized in real-world applications. To achieve this, I aim to develop technologies that allow robust dual-arm manipulation on floating bases, rather than fixed bases, even in challenging environments.
